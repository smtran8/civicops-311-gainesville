1885959,Archived,Residential Rental Maintenance,"The AC in my unit has been down for roughly 10 days now. I've tried contacting the sales manager, general manager, and office employees multiple times without a single response. They seem to be ignoring my situation. Both my roommate and I have sent complaints and we haven't heard back from them regarding the issue. I finally get my attorney involved last week and they told me that they would have the AC fixed by last Thursday or Friday or would add an extra portable AC unit. However they failed to respond after that. Then I contacted the general manager on Friday asking about the AC and he replied that he'd have it fixed by the weekend, and if not he would install a window AC on Monday. It's Tuesday now and he is continuing to ignore my messages. Its summer in Gainesville FL and without AC, one cannot live in a closed space. My roommate and I have been getting sick because of the upwards of 88 degree temperature in our apartment. The maintenence crew put a ""small room"" size portable AC in our apartment and explained that it would only be a few days. It has been almost 2 weeks and this small room AC can only cool the living room. Another issue is that my roof is leaking in my apartment when it rains. Instead of coming to fix it or patch it up, the maintenance says ""its okay for now"". Many doors around the complex are always open and it makes me feel unsafe. I also have a problem with trash piling up in the garage near the trash shoots. Noone ever cleans them up so they tend to fill up one or two parking spaces. Also, the only elevator on the premises has an expired permit. Its been expired for a month now and people are using it everyday.",2015-09-01T09:31:00.000,09/26/2018 04:06:00,Chris Arsali,1720 SW 37TH ST,29.6361748,-82.378115,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.378115, 29.6361748]}",3,,7,3,12,12,768,3,09/14/2015 15:38:00,19087,13.25486111111111111111111111,2,09/01/2015 10:45:00,74,Code Enforcement Department (Primary),

2686211,Archived,Other,"I am writing you in behalf of a resident, Ms.  Milligan, staying at Apartment #40 of the Archer Court Apartments located at 3001 SW Archer Rd. Gainesville, FL 32608. Ms. Milligan has been residing at this location for over a year and in the past 2 weeks has reported to Archer Court management a possum problem inside her apartment. 

I witnessed this for myself as a concerned friend when asked to check if the creature was still in the apartment. On Monday, June 27, 2016 at approximately 9:45PM, I entered the apartment of Ms. Milligan along with another friend, at the resident's request. The possum was relatively small and was found scurrying through a hole dug out under the floor board of the occupant's vanity. As we shone a light through the hole, we saw the creature retract further back into the hole. We at once went outside the apartment to see if there was evidence of a hole on the outside of the building where the creature may have entered. At the left side of the building, we found a square opening with a worn grating where a small dog could enter. As we shone our lights through that hole, there was the possum huddled in a corner.

Ms Milligan due to fear of the obvious accessibility of her apartment to the creature and the possibility of it carrying disease found other accommodations that evening. She has since made the issue known to the Archer Court management (Jessica - front desk personnel - 352-260-0843) several times after repeated sightings despite efforts of management to seal the hole in her apartment. 

Since the problem has yet to be resolved, Ms. Milligan is seeking to ascertain what services your offices can provide to assist in remedying the situation. Your help in this matter or pointing Ms. Milligan to the appropriate government agency would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you and we hope you can assist Ms. Milligan in addressing this dilemma.",2016-07-12T16:48:00.000,09/26/2018 16:04:00,Eric Carey,3001 SW ARCHER RD  ORIDA,29.628325,-82.367092,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.367092, 29.628325]}",4,,8,4,3,3,767,4,07/13/2016 16:42:00,1434,0.9958333333333333333333333333,2,,,Code Enforcement Department (Primary),07/13/2016 08:35:00

Subject: Trash along State Road 24

I would like to bring to the attention of the Gainesville City Commissioners, the trash that often accumulates along the south side of State Road 24 between UF Health Shands and the Malcom Randall VA Hospital.

I gather that this area is sort of a “no-man’s” land with jurisdiction shared (or not shared) between the City, the University of Florida/Shands, and the VA.

I often walk from the parking garage near the corner of Gale Lemerand Dr and State Road 24 to my office in the Shands Facilities Administration Building. I am dismayed at the trash along the walking area—especially the medical related trash such as latex gloves and face masks and sadly copious cigarette butts.

Mostly recently it has been less littered, and I did make mention of the problem to someone at Shands—so perhaps some action was taken.

But what I would hope in the long term is that the entities involved would work together to provide regular clean up this area and a cooperative educational program for visitors, patients, and employees.

Because of the prominence of the UF Health Shands medical facility and the regional status of the VA, we have a lot of people from out of town visiting this area, and I would hope that the city, the hospitals, and the local community would take pride in showing visitors a well-kept public corridor.

Thank you.

3571216,Archived,Grass (Overgrown),"Commissioner Arreola received the following e-mail from Deb Lancaster on 7/19, 7am:

Good morning.  I called yesterday afternoon and spoke with a customer service rep who advised she would transfer me to your extension.  Instead, I was sent to the voice mailbox of Adrian Santos-Hayes.  I left a message, requesting that he transfer my message to you.  In case that does not occur, I am emailing my request to you.

I reside at 4201 NW 14th PL.  I am a 64 year old widow who somehow manages to keep her yard in decent shape, which activities include mowing.  So, how it is that the City of Gainesville, with its vast resources cannot mow the grass circle on our street?  I have lived there for 41 years and the circle has been mowed regularly (every month or so) each summer.  I'm not normally a complainer, but the height of the grass/weeks is absurd.  I am 5 ft 6 and the weeds come up to my shoulder in some spots.  Of course when I checked that out, I had to wear hard, enclosed shoes, for fear of snakebite. And who knows what other wildlife is lurking amongst the overgrowth? The neighborhood kids, who sometimes use that circle for touch football or other activities, are unable to use it due to the jungle-like conditions.  If the City waits much longer, it's going to need a bush-hog.  By the way, I have observed the mowing many times in the past.  It typically takes no longer than 15-20 minutes to accomplish.  Of course, in its current state, it may now take much longer to mow.

Kindly forward my request to the appropriate department.  FYI, I have made two telephone calls to Public Works in the last few weeks, and have been told ""it's on schedule"" to be mowed.

Thank you for your consideration and assistance.

7087429,Archived,General Code Issue,"Unsecured swimming pool (no locks nor latches on gates) at 2138 NW 29th Place, Gainesville, FL is dangerous for small children in the neighborhood.
  =================  
This is a 2 story white building with a pool in the backyard.  The pool is surrounded by a chain link fence.  This fence has 2 gates, which are usually left open, and are not capable of being secured.  The gates do not have any lock or latch to prevent them being opened from outside.
  =================  
This is dangerous.  It's a big deep pool of water that someone can drown in.  It's easy to get at since the gates to the pool are left open at all times.
  =================  
I have small children.  The pool is visible through the chain link fence from public areas (visible from near the street).  My kids have tried to get at the pool when I've taken them on walks in the neighborhood.
  =================  
2138 NW 29th Place is posted as an Air BnB rental and on numerous other short term rental sites. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/38580304 https://www.vrbo.com/1803500 https://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p1803500vb https://www.stayz.com.au/holiday-rental/p1803500vb  The owner lives in California.  I have tried contacting the owner by leaving a video voice message on the Ring doorbell, which is an electronic doorbell and security system to where I can knock on the door and the Ring doorbell will record a video and send it to the owner's phone.  I have tried contacting the owner by messaging through the online hotel sites.  I attempted to text the owner, but am not sure whether or not I have his correct phone number.
  =================  
The property is managed by realtor Tammy Broxson.  Tammy Broxson messaged me back through the online hotel rental site Vrbo and stated, ""Please be aware there is no requirement to have a padlock on the gate/fence. It is trespassing to enter the property without permission. Any padlocks installed with be removed and the property authorities. Best, Tammy Broxson""
  =================  
Essentially, the realtor who is managing the rental for the owner has stated that she has no intention of securing the gate with any lock or latch.  In response to a description of my 4 year old trying to get at the pool she stated that that's trespassing.  (A small child can't trespass.)  The property manager won't put a lock or latch on the gate and won't secure the pool.
  =================  
Florida Statutes section 515.29 requires pools to be fenced and have a latch or lock on any gates which can't be operated from outside the gate by children.  That law is here http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0500-0599/0515/0515.html .  Florida Statutes, section 515.29(3) states, ""Gates that provide access to swimming pools must open outward away from the pool and be self-closing and equipped with a self-latching locking device, the release mechanism of which must be located on the pool side of the gate and so placed that it cannot be reached by a young child over the top or through any opening or gap.""
  =================  
Code enforcement can enforce this Florida law requiring a pool to be fenced and the gate to have a lock or latch that cannot be opened from the outside by children.  The state law is referenced in Gainesville city code Sec. 13-191, ""In addition to pool safety standards stated in law and rule, the following shall apply: (1) It shall be unlawful for an owner or occupant to create, maintain, keep or allow the existence of any hazardous condition, equipment, facility or fixture associated with a swimming pool, wading pool or hot tub. Failure to comply with this section shall be a major violation.""
  =================  
I don't care if you post my information online, and I checked the box to post my info.  I'm not a snitch.  I've gone (tried to go) direct to the owner first through several channels.  A combination padlock costs less than 10 dollars.  For less than 20 dollars, they could make this safe.  Instead the official written position of realtor Tammy Broxson acting on owner John Fulford's behalf is that if a 4 year old drowns in a pool that's ""trespassing to enter the property without permission"".  So, to anyone in the neighborhood reading this, I didn't report you and I won't unless you threaten to kill someone including if you are too stupid to know you've threatened to kill someone even when I've explained to you exactly how you are a threat.",2019-12-12T01:19:00.000,12/13/2019 09:54:00,Wilhelmina Randtke,2138 NW 29TH PL,29.679939,-82.3527945,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.3527945, 29.679939]}",2,,3,2,4,4,770,2,12/13/2019 09:54:00,1955,1.357638888888888888888888889,1,,,Code Enforcement Department (Primary),

I initially called on June 17th informing them of this issue. They came and looked at it and stated that it was a possibility that the person above us fell in their bathroom before we moved in. If that is the case, all repairs should have been done prior to anyone moving in. The maintenance worker even stated that this should have been fixed and they been called someone. It took two days just to have someone come in and look at it. They initially brought a plumber on June 19th just to find out that it wasn't a plumbing issue. After various attempts they finally figured out that it was indeed a flooring issue. They just poured water on the floor and the water began pouring onto my bathroom floor. They have cut a hole in the roof and have yet to come and fix it. I reached out to the office on July 6 and have let them know that this has still not been fixed. Tiffany stated she would put in a work order. But why should that even have to be done? The maintenance men that came in to observe knew what had occurred. Even if it will take a minute for someone to come out and fix it, they should at least let me know this. It is going on two months now and I still have a gaping hole in my bathroom with insects crawling out of it. My boyfriend has also reached out to the office today stating that he can have it fixed but we would need any payments on our end to be deducted from the rent.

9620964,Archived,General Code Issue,"I am new to the neighborhood - having moved here about a year ago.  I heard about the fire that occurred at 401 SE 6th Terrace about 3 years ago.  I was sorry to hear that a neighbor suffered such a terrible loss.  However, there are some serious problems at the property that can no longer be ignored and are affecting the health, property values, safety and wellbeing of everyone in the neighborhood.  I am also told that some neighbors have observed activity the property late into the evenings and early mornings, and believe that the owner, or worse, somebody other than the owner, may be living on the premises.  

I trust the city will take immediate and real action, and do something about this troubling situation.  Only the City has the authority to make this right, and citizens are forced to live with the results and consequences of the city's actions or inaction.  I have the following:

1.  Is there a valid permit on file with the City for restoration? I haven't seen any work taking place for over a year, and according to my neighbors, no work has taken place for at least two years or more.
2.  The house is in an historic district and has been allowed to become completely dilapidated.  Owners in this district, like other districts around the City are all required to comply with the strict regulations to maintain our properties in accordance with the historic district.  Why is this property permitted to negatively affect the values of surrounding properties?  Why does the City look the other way and refuse to enforce City codes that are so obviously being flouted and ignored?
3.  There are piles of trash and discarded household belongings scattered all over the property, but especially in the backyard where it is piled up to about 6' high.  Rainwater collects in and on the various items, and is causing a potentially serious refuge for diffuse mosquito breeding and proliferation.  These piles of trash are also, without irony, another potential fire hazard to the property and to the adjacent neighbors.
4.  The entire yard is completely overgrown.
5.  At least one, and possibly two unregistered vehicles are on the property, or may be parked - for years - on the city street parking.
6.  A dead animal smell has been detected coming from the garage area where a storage pod is located.
7.  Possums and raccoons have been observed going in and out of the property.
8.  The roof of the garage structure has large holes and appears to be caving in.
9.  The fence is dilapidated and doesn't appear to be structurally sound.  The piles of trash and refuse in the backyard can easily be seen through the fencing from the street.
10.  The storage pod has been in the driveway area for at least a year or more.  Is there any City ordinance regulating how long one of these pods can be kept on a property?
11.  There doesn't appear to be any power at the address.
12.  Is this property abandoned or is someone living there?

This letter is being written on behalf of multiple concerned neighbors and households who feel they deserve to remain anonymous to avoid any backlash or vindictiveness from anybody.  Other neighbors have also reported that previous complaints about this property were unheeded and ignored.  

We demand the City of Gainesville's Code Enforcement immediately look into this dilapidated property for these items listed above.  The City must take any and all necessary and legal action to bring the premises up to code, for the protection of our neighborhood and community.",2021-03-30T17:13:00.000,03/31/2021 11:34:00,An anonymous SeeClickFix user,401 SE 6TH TER,29.6481190154553,-82.3187279991427,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.3187279991427, 29.6481190154553]}",1,2,17,1,1,1,772,1,03/31/2021 11:34:00,1101,0.7645833333333333333333333333,4,,,Code Enforcement Department (Primary),

Subject: Ironwood Golf Course Condition/Illegal signage

It was disappointing to find so many of the greens at Ironwood Golf Course in deplorable condition when I played on 10/13/21.  Many greens had large, sandy areas and were marked with patches of crab grass.  Many of the tee boxes also had sandy areas, causing players to have to hit off the dirt or look for a little patch of grass to tee their ball.  I know that there is an issue with a sprinkler pump being out, but the condition of the greens and tee boxes is simply unacceptable.  Rates should be discounted until the issues are corrected.  This is all the more concerning, given that the course was closed four months for a major renovation in the summer of 2017.

Also troubling was there was no food and beverage cart operating on the course.  It was a busy Wednesday afternoon.  We had groups in front of and behind us.  A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF REVENUE WAS LOST because there was no beverage cart operating.  I know that I would have purchased a beverage on the front and back nine, had one been available.

On another issue, I am concerned about the proliferation of illegal “snipe” signs in the public right of way throughout the city.  These signs, planted up and down roadways, advertise everything from restaurants to pressure washing service to computer repair to help wanted, etc.

These signs are illegal for a good reason.  They distract motorists’ attention from necessary roadway signage, and they are “visual pollution.”  Code enforcement officers should proactively attack this growing problem.  It’s not expensive or time consuming to safely pull over and toss this illegal litter in the back of a pickup truck or trunk of a car.  If they are allowed to continue to proliferate, every roadway in the city will be strewn with them.

I’m not one to take time to write emails such as this, which I think illustrates the seriousness of both",2021-10-15T15:58:00.000,12/06/2021 01:33,Gary Nelson,", Gainesville, FL",,,,,,,,,,,,12/06/2021 01:33,51840,36,,12/06/2021 01:33,,Clerk,

Not my or my roomates room, or the apartment in its entireity. The crew themselves commented on the apartment's stench, and upon opening the compartment that shields the AC, they noticed that the AC was covered in black mold, the filter included, and also had substancial corrosion. The cleaning crew even refused to stay in the apartment for more than 10 minutes in fear for their health.

1903135,Archived,Grass (Overgrown),"I reported this property 1 1/2 years ago. The owner did mow the lawn and kept it up until he moved. The house was foreclosed on and some repairs were made on it. It now has a sign that a rental agency based in Orlando is posting it for rental. However, I found the agency hard to find on the Internet, but I did finally locate it. Do not know who owns it now, the mortgage company  or an individual. While it was being foreclosed, etc. a team of people came about once a week to mow. Since the agency put the sign up, no mowing has been done since early June. A notice still on a front window has the phone number for the group doing the yard work. A truck is parked in the driveway, but it belongs to a guy across the street who just started parking it there about 2 weeks ago, it may have been vandalized, etc. when parked at the business.  Not sure if this will work, but here is the house on the Internet.

The neighbor to the south has walked into the backyard and he said he saw a hole in the eaves where squirrels are getting into the attic. Birds in my yard chased a 3-foot snake out of my backyard into its overgrown backyard. BTW there is a lot of skunk vine and poison ivy in the backyard, so be careful.

I will be gone a bit of time tomorrow morning, Sept. 10, running errands. Feel free to go into my backyard to look into the yard south of me if you want to avoid poison ivy.

We have notified our landlord of these issues and have been met with rudeness and reluctance to fix things. It took our landlord over two years provide us with heat since the date of our occupancy despite being required to by state law. It was finally installed this week and then unit is still missing a filter box or place to filter the incoming air. Right now, we have had to tape a filter to the outside of the a/c unit in order to filter the air so it doesn't destroy the unit. Our roof was leaking for 8 months until it was finally fixed despite numerous requests. These issues the landlord was informed about in writing about numerous times. We are currently experiencing issues (in addition to the issues with a/c) with the floor tile cracking in the kitchen and living room; the provided washer/dryer not working; the faucet in the kitchen sink constantly sticking; and the palm tree pushing on the roof by our bedroom. Our landlord has been made aware of all these issues and has done little to ameliorate the situation. When we informed our landlord of these things and other issues with the property, we are met with rudeness and accusations of “breaking things” that have been affected by normal wear and tear and the age of the appliances. For example, he accused us of breaking the dish washer by placing ""a foreign object"" in the dishwasher drain hose when there is no way we could have done that. We possess neither the skill or the will to deliberately destroy any appliance including a dish washer.

It's 530pm on Tuesday August 21st and I am unable to leave the Hermitage neighborhood. Grays Tree Service has the only street out of the neighborhood blocked with equipment and vehicles. I was told they had 2 trees to remove and they would be there ""a while"". I was told the only way out was to jump the curb and drive through the customers yard.I can't imagine this is safe or legal. What would happen if someone needed  emergency services? Tell a fire truck or ambulance to jump the curb and drive through someones lawn? Thank you.

7321481,Archived,Trash/Debris (Public Property),"To whom it may concern, 

Hello. I am currently a resident living in a tent at Dignity Village, and I would like to make a request concerning a recent change in waste management. 

My tent is located in the first section of the southwest corner at Grace Marketplace. There is a road that circles around Grace, and as you are heading south on the road, just before you turn the corner to go east, there is a designated area at the edge of the lot, which contains 3 porta-potties and a cube shaped dumpster with two lids. Both the porta-potties and the dumpster are situated a minimum of 50-60 ft away from any tents. Or, you might say - none of the residents have chosen to set up their tents within 50-60 ft of the designated bathroom and dumpster area. This seems to be a sufficient distance for everyone. However, on Friday morning, January 31st, the dumpster was removed, and a large rectangular dumpster with no lids was placed right in the middle of the main tent area, within 15-20 ft of several of the tents, including my own. 

Although I do not contribute to this myself, it is an unfortunate truth of this type of living environment that the dumpsters will tend to contain urine, feces, and other raw waste, such as old meat. Because of its close vicinity, and because it does not have any lids, I am able to smell the waste from my tent, and there are flies whenever I walk outside my door.

In addition to this, it causes an excess of noise, which has made it difficult for me to sleep at night. When the dumpster is moved from 60 ft away (where it was) to 15ft away (where it is now), it may appear to be a subtle difference to an outsider, but it causes a sound increase of 12db, which more than doubles the perceived volume. Whenever anything is thrown into the dumpster, it usually creates a loud thud sound, which I can not only hear, but I can feel as well, as it shakes the ground. 

I do understand that living in a tent, I am not in a position to expect the same standards as someone living in a house or an apartment, but I would like to respectfully request that the dumpster be moved to its previous position, or to another suitable position that would be located 50 or more feet from any of the tents. And preferably I believe it ought to be the kind of dumpster with lids, so that the flies and smell may be better contained. 

In regards to sound, I do not expect total quiet, and accordingly, I wear earphones literally 24hrs/day. Under normal conditions, the headphones are sufficient for blocking all or most of the sound from the surrounding area. But with the dumpster in its new location, I am able to hear trash being thrown several times per hour, and as I said, this occurs after 10pm at night as well.

Another problem is that the dumpster tends to create debris, and attract scavengers. For example, currently there is a heap of scrap tent materials between the dumpster and my tent. The accepted etiquette here is for anything which may potentially be of use to be left outside the dumpster. Additionally, there are people who regularly check the dumpster for these types of things, and there are also people who regularly go into the dumpster itself in order to retrieve aluminum cans and other items. 

Since the dumpster has been placed in its current position, it has been extremely disturbing for me. If it is possible to move the dumpster to where it was previously, and to return to the type with lids, I would be very grateful for your concern. 

Thank you.

4846753,Archived,Other,"With the start of the fall semester, I have noticed an uptick in visitors to Alfred A Ring Park, many of whom are dog owners with off-leash dogs. Yesterday in the park, my on-leash dog was chased and pounced on by an off-leash greyhound whose owner apologized for her dog’s natural behavior rather than her own irresponsible behavior and inability to control her dog. This is just one of several encounters my dog and I have had with off-leash dogs in the last few weeks alone; rarely have we come across an off-leash dog that did not either aggressively bark at us or come up to my dog with the hope of following her through the park as we went on our way. I am writing to ask if you can have a park ranger visit the park and remind visitors with off-leash dogs of Alachua County Ordinance Section 72.12. I am also wondering if the city can post some simple signage about the ordinance and its enforcement (perhaps fines involved) so that visitors with dogs will at lease become educated.

This bus-stop is right at a curve in the road. This could easily have been avoided if there were some bollards on the curb at the bus-stop, so that even if cars lose control on the curve, they wouldn't get on to the sidewalk. Since the bollards are on the curb, it wouldn't affect vehicular movement on the road nor restrict pedestrians on the sidewalk. I've contacted Gainesville Public Works Department (service request # 5836) and said they would approve bollards if it was required. Kindly look into this.

I'm not sure I'm emailing the right person, but I want to report that I have seen, on several occasions, people (student aged) either fishing or touching wildlife at Lake Alice (across from the bat houses). On one occasion, about a week ago, I saw a boy catch a large bass fish, and on another occasion I saw student-aged people standing really close to a gator and trying to take a picture with it, while also yelling and gesturing to the gator. There are no signs in the area about respecting the wildlife (besides just alerting people to the potential presence of gators), and there are no signs about not fishing whatsoever. Since I believe this is a conservation area, I was hoping to have some signs put in the area indicating that these are wrongful behaviors, and potentially have an officer of some kind patrolling the area to ensure the wildlife wont be disturbed. If this has not reached the right person, please put me in contact with the proper area.

She was told the issue was a building permit matter.  However, Building Permits informed her they only do new construction.  In addition, the neighbor informed Building Permits they were putting in a garden.  Even if true, they cannot plant a garden on City property.  This resident has cancer, and feels she's being given the run around trying to get someone to take action on this.

I understand Supervisor, Billy Dampier was supposed to look at the hydrant on June 4, 2018 but it is still leaking. If there's a fire and Gainesville Fire Rescue needs to use it, will the integrity of the fire hydrant caused by this continual leak affect their response?

Shown is just one example of trying to fill a circle, but (if successful) would block the view to the Cade Museum — not very tourist friendly to do that. Some palms died, but a live oak was added right in the viewline, too. Instead of filling every circle with plant life, which blends in with backgrounds in other locations, please consider architectural shapes like obelisks, arches, columns, lighthouses, sculptures, etc to show drivers they need to slow down. Well lit at night as well. I think filling circles with only trees and bushes blends in with backgrounds sometimes, and new residents or tourists won't slow down in time.

3542512,Archived,Grass (Overgrown),I reported the overgrown corners at the north and south sides of South Main Street and SE 1st ave on Monday the 3rd. This morning when I arrived the work crew had come out and it looks like they used a weed eater to trim about a foot around the borders. Now I will say they did fill in the huge pot hole that was on the north corner but the grassy areas look HORRIBLE!!!!! I would think that the city would have a little bit more pride in the appearance of the downtown area. The Plaza and looks amazing (except the south side brick pavers-huge tripping hazard. I have stumbled repeatedly). But there is a lot of traffic both vehicle and pedestrian on Main Street and I would think that nice plants or even just mulch would look so much better than a jungle. We are just a law office but there are several restaurants near us and I know we have a big problem with mice and lizards living in the grasses right next to our door.  Please come and take care of these two corners.

8181027,Archived,Right-of-Way Maintenance,"Recently when the guys who work for the city mowed the east side of NW24th Blvd they also apparently put out some kind of herbicide here at this drainage culvert, as well as around several signs! 
Why? When we are told to be mindful of our lawn runoff that feeds into area ponds, streams, and creeks- WHY would the city approve the use of poison that will/ has drained into the pond which this drainage system goes into. There are two ponds on this beautiful wooded area which flow into the storm drainage stream that runs along the bike trail between 45th and 39th Ave.
We’ve lived here in this area since 1999, and walk this sidewalk twice a day, and have never seen this done, why would y’all start this nonsense now? The only plants that were growing there were Spanish Needle, a native wildflower and important pollinator plant. They could have been easily cut down ( IF they were a problem, which they weren’t) instead of using a herbicide? 
Please tell me this won’t happen again! My husband and I find it highly hypocritical for Gainesville and Alachua County to tell its citizens not do do something like this, and yet allow its employees to do it. We are extremely disappointed by this.

3841784,Archived,Trash/Debris (Private Property),"I wrote on this website a few minutes ago and tried to submit the information. Somehow the description was deleted. I will try again -- hope this is not a duplicate.

During Hurricane Irma three large trees fell from my neighbor's property at 1114 NE 6th Street onto their property and my property. The trees that fell on my property were cleaned-up on September 25th, and the debris was subsequently picked up by the city.

Someone connected with 1114 NE 6th Street eventually hired a tree service to clean up that property. One of the other neighbors told me within the last couple of week that the company cannot complete the job; no one seems to have been working over there for quite a while.

I also have been told that the occupants have moved away from Gainesville; the occupants were not the homeowner. 

I would like to have my fence repaired and my property maintained appropriately; the fence cannot be repaired until the neighbor's property is cleaned up --at least on the south side of their property's back yard. However, separate from the fence repair, I am also concerned about the amount of debris that keeps sitting on the property of an unoccupied and damaged house -- especially when no one around here seems to know who is ""in charge"" of the house and property at this time.

I would like my request to be anonymous. I do not want to risk having uncomfortable situation.

5462416,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,The traffic cycle has either recently been adjusted and needs to be re-adjuster for correction or is broken. The traffic at this light in the last month or two is terrible and the wait time to turn left is taking way too long and the flow of traffic is awful.  It's making for more aggressive driving and some folks just running the redlight - if this continue in this school zone someone is going to cause an accident.  Someone of authority needs to visit this area in the work day mornings from 7:00 a.m. to at least 8:00 a.m. to see all the issues occurring.  I spend 10 to 15 minutes in traffic in the a.m. now trying to turn left from 53rd onto 43rd at this traffic light.  Sometimes we do not get a green turn arrow at all - it goes directly to flashing yellow.  Sometimes when the cross walk is enabled when it's done we don't even get a green turn arrow - it goes directly to yellow flashing arrow.  When we do get the green turn arrow it now seems like the green arrow signal is not as long as it use to be - there may be 10 cars that get to turn.  Traffic at this intersection is now more increasingly backed up more than ever.  I have lived in Mile Run for 15 years now and this is the worst intersection for trying to get to work in the a.m.  My commute time in the a.m. is now extending at least 20 minutes due to this intersection and the intersection of 43rd. and 39th trying to get to the interstate.  It's very frustrating with the 'new' traffic cycles and all the long-term road construction that has been going on for months.  We need some relief in this area - traffic and road conditions are horrible - the worst I've seen in the area since I've lived in this area for 15 year plus.,2019-02-28T09:05:00.000,02/28/2019 09:49:00,City of Gainesville Neighbor,4300-4320 MILLHOPPER RD,29.703258,-82.3888935,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.3888935, 29.703258]}",2,,2,2,5,5,769,2,02/28/2019 09:49:00,44,0.03055555555555555555555555556,1,,,Public Works Department (Primary),

Dear Mayor Poe:

I am writing about the intersection of SW 16th Avenue and SW 16th Street.  

The street light at this intersection was removed many months ago when new stoplights were installed.  The new traffic control lights are now fully operational, but the street light has not been replaced.  

This is a very busy intersection.  It is a block from both Shands and the VA hospitals, and gets a lot of pedestrian traffic before dawn.  

We have e-mailed several other city departments about this in the past month, but no action has been taken.  Let's not have a traffic accident or fatality that could have been prevented by a streetlight.

We trust that you can use your good offices to expedite the replacement of this streetlight.  Thank you very much.

Sincerely,
Paula Dufort",2017-06-14T10:14:00.000,09/27/2018 06:25:00,City Clerk's Office 2,SW 16TH AVE AND SW 16TH ST,29.6357655,-82.3431284,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.3431284, 29.6357655]}",4,,16,4,3,3,767,4,06/14/2017 10:15:00,1,0.0006944444444444444444444444444,4,,,GRU Electric Operations Primary,

People are tossing them out in the wild, they cannot survive, their DNA is totally different. I am already working with my local officials to stop the sales of rabbits in stores. I am also in contact with local Congressmen and the Governor to put a Bill into place like California has, starting in 2019. The sales of Dogs, Cats and Rabbits will end, only rescue or shelter animals will be sold. This is turning into an environmental hazard, as they spread disease to other domestic animals and humans. I urge your Government to stop the sales of rabbits. The rabbits at this store are ending up in shelters to be destroyed when they get to old and or a rescue will step in and take. The rescues, all over Florida are full with more coming in everyday. Please help us make this happen, sooner then later. I live in St. Lucie County and Port St Lucie, my Mayor is already putting it into place. We also had the law changed, NO sales or giving away of Baby Rabbits under the age of 8 weeks. Please ask any rescue, how you can tell the difference, so your Animal Control and enforce this new law. Gainesville Rabbit Rescue is overwhelmed and trying to save every Rabbit that comes through that store, and its just to much. I work closely with a lot of the rescues and everyone is overwhelmed. Please contact them and ask how this can be stopped.

When the Fletcher Oaks development was being put in, the developer dug up the grassy strip on the north side of NW 31st Avenue between the road and the sidewalk to put in a drainage pipe between NW 26th and NW 27th Streets that met up with the sewer at the corner of NW 31st Avenue and NW 27th Street. During that work the developer removed many trees that the City of Gainesville and neighbors had planted in that strip. The five photos below demonstrate that fact. Requested is for similar-sized trees to those removed be planted to maintain the beautiful tree canopy of this scenic road and sidewalk.

The five photos are as follow:
Photo 1: Name of newly developed neighborhood for which the developer removed the trees (Fletcher Oaks)
Photo 2: Street sign at the entrance of the new development
Photo 3: View looking east from the above-noted corner showing the older existing trees, as well as the trees the City planted within the last 10 years in the distance 
Photo 4: Closer view of the remaining trees the City planted along NW 31st Avenue east of NW 26th Street to maintain the tree canopy
Photo 5: View west from the corner of NW 31st Avenue and NW 26th Street showing the strip of land from which trees were removed by the developer and not replanted.

Your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. If I can provide any additional information let me know.

In March I installed a fence along my back property. Just recently there has been some damage done to it, caused either by GRU, city personnel, or other contracted landscapers.

I would like to arrange a time to talk with someone about this damage and show them additional pictures. 

I understand that some thru-way maintenance may cause wear and tear on infrastructure at the property line, but this goes beyond what I believe is acceptable.  I spent a substantial amount of time and money on this property improvement and within a few months the full aesthetic has been vandalized. I would like to talk to someone about preventing this from happening in the future, as well as remedying the stains that occurred on the fence.

That wouldn't be an issue except we've been finding nasty things like buckets full of human poop right near the retention pond. The trash is piling up in the area. Local residents don't feel safe, and I worry about the human fecal matter being dumped in the retention pond which feeds directly into the storm drain and to the Duck Pond itself a few blocks away.

Us local residents aren't sure if we can report the people loitering around the building. They appear to sleep in front, to the side, and probably behind the building. It's a daily thing with them sometimes heading out and leaving it before returning in the afternoons.

Please let me know if I should be reporting this regularly (in which case I can text an officer if that's easier or open repeated cases here), or if there is no point in reporting this issue at all (meaning they have the right to live around this abandoned building).

Some (not all) of the vehicles that are currently parked on the side of the road are inoperable (mechanic work being performed IN the street).

This creates a dangerous situation when vehicles turn onto NW 36th Avenue from NW 6th Street and other vehicles traveling at the same time heading West on NW 36th Avenue meet at that intersection with only enough room for one vehicle to get by. When this happens one car must pull into a residential driveway or drive their vehicle in reverse just so one car can pass. If a driver stops short when turning onto NW 36th Avenue from NW 6th Street (because they see a road block/traffic jam ahead) this could cause an accident on NW 6th where other unaware drivers going 40+ mph are not expecting to come to a complete stop to wait for the traffic to clear on NW 36th Avenue.

The remaining trunk obstructs the view when traffic is trying to turn onto NW 6th from 15th Ave, forcing drivers to inch forward to see around the remaining trunk and impeding the crosswalk for pedestrians especially handicapped people in wheelchairs.  Now the remaining trunk has sprouted side branches all along its remaining wood, further blocking the view of traffic heading north on 6th Street for cars trying to turn from 15th Avenue.  These new branches are creating a serious hazard. Trimming those branches will only alleviate the problem until they grow back.

6156370,Archived,Trash/Debris (Private Property),"Currently NW 55th Blvd is clean due to private citizens doing a clean-up. But it is a pervasive problem that the property owners should take care of.  The next road on NW 55th Ave. is currently terribly littered.

""I live in an apartment complex on NW 55th Blvd and the amount of litter people toss out of their cars daily is astounding. It is a curvy road with no sidewalks, in a wooded area, with two gas stations nearby. It is my understanding that this street is not managed by the City of Gainesville and it is not managed by Alachua County (although the EPA does drive by to check Hogtown Creek). Public Works does not mow or remove the litter. I’m told the street is privately owned, but only Creekwood Apts (where I live) picks up litter in front of their property. So, is there a way to contact the street owner? Particularly Palmetto Crerk and Palmetto Walk, which both have copious Litter along their entrances, in the woods. Is this a code violation? I’d like to discuss whether I am allowed to put up signage to encourage folks to keep NW 55th Blvd street clean. See my Instagram account #LitterFreeGNV to view some of the litter I’ve picked up there in only a few months. I find diapers, syringes, and drug baggies regularly, and we live near the creek! . It is relentless. People dump tires and all kinds of other stuff in the forest and on roadsides, as well. We need a litter education campaign in Gville that goes beyond the annual Great American Clean-up. That event is great, but it’s not enough... I see litter all over Gville and it saddens me. I’m sure the plastic bag and styrofoam ban will help; but a bottle deposit would also help; I find tons of recyclables, too.

Good Afternoon Mayor Poe and Commissioners,
I wrote in approximately 2 weeks ago about this same issue.  
In taking a bike ride through downtown today, toward Depot Park, I encountered the same trash accumulation I reported on 2 weeks ago outside the now closed Sweet Mel’s Restaurant. The issue has clearly not been addressed and now there is additional trash present and the wooden fence door now stands open exposing the debris to an even greater degree.  This is a main thoroughfare to our downtown area.  There are frequent articles and statements by Mayor Poe and the Commissioners stating they would like to improve the Downtown/East side of Gainesville yet this particular issue goes seemingly unchecked. The owner of the property, per public record is a local urologist.  It is unfortunate that there are people in this town who choose to litter and not take pride in themselves and or their town.  It is however, the owners responsibility to ensure their property is managed properly and kept clean.  If this issue occurred in one night, I could understand there may be a delay in the owner’s responsiveness to tend to the debris.  This is not the case in this instance.  If this were public property, certainly the City would put our taxpayer dollars to work to clean the area.  The fact that it is privately owned posses a different issue.  Please, take action.  Please take a walk, make a call…

Is this what we want for Gainesville?  Is this the picture we want for our ""New American City"" ad??

Message:
Hello, On April 10 <(>&<)> 11, 2019, GRU did an emergency replacement of
my water feed line and this problem was caused by the SE 4th street
construction project. The line replacement caused the ""rainwater
management curb"" in front of my house to be damaged. The rainwater curb
keeps my house from flooding and the road run-off from going down the
hill to Sweetwater Creek. Please consider re-evaluating the storm water
management on SE 14th Place as a lot of rainwater runs from the crest of
14th Place (which is most of the road) towards my house. Thank you,

One can clearly see generally there is maybe 10 inches or so between the white road lines and the sidewalk... except where they just laid down there curb/sidewalk it's right on the white line if not over.  This really squeezes a cyclist into the curb.  I'm not sure if they are in violation but is yet another way Gainesville is discouraging cyclist from riding where they have a right to.

Subject: Casino at 1138 NE 16th Avenue, Gainesville, Florida

Dear City Commissioners,

I am once again asking for help to get my landlord to stop leasing the building adjacent to our preschool for illegal purposes, a casino.  Casinos are illegal in Gainesville, although the landlord, Edward Jennings, Jr.. has leased the property adjacent to our preschool for illegal purposes three times in the last two years.  I have personally witnessed a bodyguard with a gun on his waist and my fear is that someone will come in to rob the casino and there will be a gunfight with bullets flying everywhere.  I have already notified Mayor Poe of this, and they did close down the casino, but reopened it three weeks later and it is currently still open.  Another concern that I  have is that our parents cannot park their vehicles in front of our school building to pick up their children because the casino patrons park directly in front of our building, but the county told me that there has to be dedicated parking spaces so that preschool students will not have to walk through a parking lot to get to the school building, so right now there is some type of violation taking place as a result of the parking situation.  If this is something that cannot be resolved on the local level, please refer me to someone who can get this problem resolved permanently, or until our lease is up in June of 2022?

Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,




Dr. Denise M. Brown,
Director

1853833,Archived,Other,"I am writing because I have my 5 month infant daughter in child care at Sunshine House on 39th Ave. They have a chronic issue with the parking lot flooding, when I asked about this, they told me there is a tree on City property that has caused a major back up with the storm drain. This causes a large accumulation of standing water that I am concerned to be a health hazard as the water backs up and inundates the play area and parking lot making it difficult for parent pick up and drop off.  As well, the standing water is likely to be a risk as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and bacteria where there are obviously children present. I understand that this is private property, but if the drainage system was damaged from a tree on city property, and in the interest of the children who attend this facility, I'd like to encourage GRU or City of Gainesville to take another look at this problem before it becomes a serious health risk. The water stands for days on end after heavy rains.

5245056,Archived,Road Repair,"You have probably received quite a few reports about this issue. But, I thought I should also issue a report (because this could become a very serious issue).

I've noticed that NW 43rd St has several bumps (between NW 39th Ave and Newberry Road). I'm not really sure why they poured cement over all of those manholes. I actually just moved back to Gainesville recently. So, I'm not sure when they performed this maintenance on NW 43rd St. 

But, I thought I should probably say something. The reason I thought I should say something is that I noticed that drivers are beginning to drive in the bicycle lanes (to avoid the ""bumpy manholes""). So, this could create a problem for bicyclists. Sometimes the visibility isn't too great at nighttime. So, drivers may find it difficult to see bicyclists riding in those bicycle lanes.

Additionally the light is too short and often only allows 4-5 cars through especially when some of the traffic has to make left hand turns across traffic. There is hardly enough east-west traffic to warrant the long wait for north-south cars. The left turn arrow for traffic heading north and turning west is also disproportionate and should be shorter.

6447257,Archived,Parking Enforcement,"On 5/22, 5/28, and 6/6, I emailed Lt. Rowe and Capt. Kurnick about the increase in trucks parking in the tow-away zones on NE10th St at University, narrowing the street to one lane (or less), while the drivers eat at McDonald's. Legal, safe parking is available on the rights of way half a block north. I never received a reply and the problem continues unabated. The attached photo is from Wed. Can you tell us what's being done to alleviate this safety hazard? Thanks.

""Years ago the city posted ""No Parking - Tow Away Zone"" signs on both sides of NE 10th St. between University Ave. and 1st Ave. Trucks and buses were parking there to eat at the McDonad's on the corner, creating a serious safety hazard. Cars turning north onto 10th from University or the McDonald's exit would find (1) a vehicle illegally parked in the northbound lane, forcing them into the southbound one where they often found an oncoming vehicle, or (2) a southbound vehicle forced into  their lane because a vehicle was illegally parked in the southbound one. With the fencing off of the large vacant lot across University for construction, illegal parking of trucks and buses has become more frequent. Like noise it's a low priority, and each vehicle isn't there for long. Would it be possible to get increased parking enforcement patrols there during breakfast and lunch for a little while to at least warn the repeat offenders and help alleviate the problem?

Hello Mr Mayor

            I live in downtown Gainesville and I have noticed a disturbing practice in regards to the trash receptacles. In particular the trash can on the north east corner of the Hippodrome, one farther east next to the sun center by the road and another across from the Union Street Station next to the empty lot. 
          There are never bags in these and they are filthy. Sometimes they are overflowing onto the street. I believe bags would contain the juices and filth from seeping around these foul containers. It’s just nasty and probably not sanitary. It looks bad. I believe better maintenance of these receptacles would greatly improve the esthetics of the downtown. They could use a good pressure washing too. Maybe it is all of the trash bins downtown that are being neglected but these I walk by most days. 
           Also I have conjured ideas to improve the cleanliness of the terrible dumpster fiasco south of the downtown library. Many times the unsightly privacy fence is open exposing filthy dumpsters. There is frequently loose trash on the ground in the parking lot that this dumpster pit resides. It smells horrid and pungent. I believe a better less prominent location could be found for what I believe is mostly food waste from restaurants. I live next to the Sun Center and the dumpster in their parking lot constantly has trash and broken glass in front of it and smells like wet, pungent neglect. If you look at the back of the dumpsters you will see the dumpsters fluid spill way that drains into the road onto what I believe is 4th ave, the road that goes by GRU. 
            Thank you so much for considering remedies to these issues, I feel it will greatly improve the feel of our beautiful downtown.

As this home business appears to be unregistered, it may not be collecting required bed taxes or reporting income or meeting safety and sanitation requirements.

The website (see below) advertising her property says she is renting out two of her three bedrooms as well as a couch elsewhere in the home for nightly or longer stays (some as long as 40 days according to reviews). She does not let her guests park in her driveway and as a result there are often three or more vehicles parked on the street in front of hers and her neighbors’ homes. This is a hindrance to emergency and other vehicles on the narrow street as well as an inconvenience to neighbors parking and coming or leaving their properties.

8780844,Archived,General Code Issue,"I apologise if this isn't the correct means to report this issue, I've never had to file a complaint like this before and I'm not sure who to go to. 

My adjacent neighbor located in unit Q203 at Treehouse Village 109 SE 16th ave has been doing what looks and sounds like major construction for months. They are definitely doing something big because they've created a huge amount of debris that fills the shared residential dumpster every week making it difficult to fit my own garbage in. There were extremely loud banging and machine noises happening non-stop from around 8am to 8pm a month ago and one of my neighbors directly below that unit has been dealing with water pouring into her ceiling from their construction on at least 4 separate occasions now. So they're definitely doing something with plumbing or damaging pipes. 

I've heard them speaking english but when I tried once a couple weeks ago to ask about the water leaks the same guys seemed to not understand English. I asked them if they pulled permits and they played dumb like they didn't understand and went back inside the unit. They don't have any kind of construction notices or a project board displayed, but I have no idea if that's even required. 

I rent my unit through a separate landlord, not the Treehouse apartments, but I contacted the Treehouse office and they told me that Q203 is not managed by them, so they said they will try to get ahold of the landlord but there wasn't much they were allowed to do about it other than issue noise complaints. I also tried to contact their landlord, but they haven't responded to any of my inquires. 

I am not worried about the noise, I know that's unavoidable when repairs need to be done and it has mostly stopped, but I have doubts about their construction licenses and I am concerned about major water damage happening to my unit like my neighbors have experienced several times already.I apologise if this isn't the correct means to report this issue, I've never had to file a complaint like this before and I'm not sure who to go to.

While there are access points from the Porters neighborhood to the bike trail, there are no pass through access to the sidewalk on the east side of SW6th Avenue from Depot down to about 5th Ave due to a black metal fence.  I am not sure what purpose this fence serves, other than to prevent people from Porters from accessing the sidewalk.  Other areas with high density student housing like Jefferson Place that are just down the street do not have a metal fence blocking their access to the sidewalk, so why does the Porters Neighborhood need to be blocked from the sidewalk on 6th?  Maybe after all the construction is done on SW 6th the city can consider leaving the fence down and allowing the people of Porters easy access to the sidewalk.  At the very least, pass through to the sidewalk should be provided at multiple points along this purposeless fence.  If the fence has a purpose, please let me know what that purpose is, and why this particular neighborhood needs less access to the city sidewalk than the rest of the communities along 6th.",2017-05-13T09:15:00.000,09/27/2018 05:15:00,soodohnim,600 SW 6TH ST,29.6449960825706,-82.3312180076307,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.3312180076307, 29.6449960825706]}",1,2,15,1,1,1,772,1,05/15/2017 15:08:00,3233,2.245138888888888888888888889,4,05/15/2017 08:08:00,2813,Public Works Department (Primary),

2578016,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,"I am not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but traffic going north on 34th street gets really backed up from 4-6PM before the intersection with W University Avenue.  Sometimes it backs up all the way up the hill by the wall with the graffiti and goes down the other side.  Not sure if anyone else has witnessed this, but I would imagine so since lots of people seem to be caught in the traffic every day.  Perhaps they are distracted by looking at the graffiti and don't really notice.  While I like the 34th street wall a lot, I don't really like being rear-ended by people coming over the hill near the wall and then suddenly finding that the middle lane is completely backed up.  In worrying about being rear-ended, I don't really get a chance to admire the handiwork on the wall unfortunately.  
Luckily for the very few people turning left on University, there are two completely traffic free turn lanes for them to choose from.  They don't have to worry.  The left turn people are the super lucky few.  The right turn people on to W University also get a nice empty lane to themselves as well, and even have the option of turning right on 25A, and so probably don't really even need a whole turn lane to themselves, but lucky them, they got one anyway.  
Meanwhile the one center lane that goes straight just backs up every day, over the hill, past the nice graffiti wall, full of people who work hard all day and just want to get home to their kids.  Those poor people just trying to get home wait for the light at W University Avenue to change 3-4 times between five and six o'clock before they cross. 
It is worth noting that if you are coming south on NW 34th Avenue towards W Univ Ave, there are three lanes to choose from, and only one turn lane.  Somehow, when the redesign of the intersection happened, it was determined that a single lane road coming south should widen to three lanes at University Ave, while the three busy lanes going north should narrow to one lane prior to University Avenue, with two left turn lanes and one right turn lane flanking a crowded center lane.   
Anyway, hope that something can be done, and I encourage everyone stuck in the northbound single lane from 4-6PM to utilize the SeeClickFix app on your phone or call your local government representatives to let them know how you feel about this intersection.  Just don't text and drive!  Well, you will be sitting there for a long while so maybe it is safe to text or call.  Again though, it is probably only me and I am just being crazy and impatient thinking that we could have two lanes going north instead of one.  I should just enjoy the graffiti and relax.  My kids don't need me that badly, they will be just fine.  Maybe I should encourage them to paint the wall at that time, at least that way I would get to see them a little sooner after a long day at work :/",2016-06-09T21:51:00.000,12/18/2019 15:55:00,soodohnim,3401 W UNIVERSITY AVE,29.6520265129911,-82.3723523650831,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.3723523650831, 29.6520265129911]}",3,,5,3,6,6,768,3,07/05/2016 11:54:00,36842,25.58472222222222222222222222,1,06/13/2016 08:13:00,4942,Public Works Department (Primary),

2115529,Archived,General Code Issue,"We own property at 1109 NE 2nd Street and our son and his wife own the new home at 1107 NE 2nd Street (which is directly behind our home at 1110 NE 3rd Street).

The vacant lot to the immediate north of our property at 1109 NE 2nd Street now has a squatter living in a tent. Our granddaughter lives next to this lot, and our two dogs and our son’s dog all use our lot freely, which is immediately next to the tent of the squatter.

The police department suggested that I contact you to start a process to get these people moved. The estate of a local family owns the lot, and I don’t know how to contact them. This isn't safe for our family, nor sanitary, nor is it fair to those who have tried to beautify this section of our neighborhood. There are several tents on the block one block closer to 16th Ave., on land owned by the City (adjoining NE Park), and the fact that the City has allowed those squatters to remain for more than a year is probably why this squatter feels no one will remove them. I'm hoping you can help us protect the safety and sanitation of our neighborhood.

Please let me know if I've reached you, and if there is anything we can do from here.

Yours truly,

I reported this rented house a few weeks ago. The landlord/renter are not moving the lawn or clearing the property from wild bushes, trees and vines for over a year. This is the only home on our street that looks like a hunted house.

I plan to sell my house soon and I can't show the backyard to buyers with that wild grown mess.

It stood up with its paws on the fence, which clearly was not tall enough to restrict it to the yard..  After we had passed by on the other side of the street and were several houses away, the dog jumped over the fence and ran after us in a very aggressive manner.  It was terrifying, as my dog is only 4 months old and I was afraid the large dog would attack us both.  We continued to walk quickly away from the dog, and after a few minutes turned to see and the dog had disappeared.  I warned another dog walker approaching me not to go near this house.  This dog needs to be restrained in the yard with a higher fence or on a leash, or kept inside.

3692800,Archived,Road Repair,"Hello,

I'm a life-long Gainesville resident and am on faculty at UF. I'm sorry to bother you, I tried calling earlier today and discovered your office was closed for the storm. I respect you're busy with storm preparations, as am I, and hope all is going well for you & your families.

I'm reaching out to you as I'm very concerned about the construction on NE 6th Avenue between 1st and 5th Streets.
My home is at 305 NE 6th Avenue, I've lived upstairs since 2003 and my father moved in to the downstairs in 2014, he passed away in April from cancer, so I now own both units and am hosting guests evacuating from Miami, in his home, for the storm.

For the past 2-3 months there has been construction on NE 6th Ave between 1st - 5th Streets.
The road was just paved a few days ago and it appears the gutters & curbs are under construction.
I fear that during the storm, in the sections that remain unfinished, the dirt will erode and the entire area will flood.
However, I'm most afraid of the 8 barricades (they look like this: http://www.bobsbarricades.com/bimages/products/barracade1.jpg) currently installed along the north & west sides of NE 6th Ave in the 300 block (immediately in front of my home, built in 1912).

Officials have repeatedly warned that any unsecured objects may become airborne and act as projectiles, shattering windows, etc.
My home is 103 years old and all of the windows are original and impossible to replace (the lovely warped glass). Earlier today I spent two hours moving everything in our yard that's not buried/secured, into the garage-- the porch furniture, potted plants, hoses, our mailbox, trash & recycling bins, etc., as I'm doing the best I can to prevent storm damage.  Can someone please insure me that those barricades will all be removed prior to Sunday?

Ideally, I'd love to hear that the gutters and curbs will also be completed before the rain begins as the lack of concrete in those areas is likely going to cause water to erode the dirt, pool, and flood-- impacting my yard & home and the Thomas Center south-side parking lot.

With much appreciation & respect,

We have been without power since Monday. A large tree fell in our neighbors yard ontop of our power line and knocked out power for my house, our immediate neighbor to the right, and the two house behind us. We have reported this issue to GRU every day, sometimes a couple times a day since our outage occurred. Every other house on our street has power. We are right across from the Law Library on UF's campus. We don't understand why our problem is continually unresolved. I feel as if we may be overlooked because we are the first two houses on the street and all other homes have power so it couple be possible that GRU thought this entire street was fixed when it has not been.

Please help us fix this problem in a timely manner. This is an old home and it's beginning to wreak of mildew from the heat. Also-- school has resumed normal operations and we are still living without power. Help us understand why this problem isn't resolved! Is there something more we should be doing?

6387123,Archived,General Police Enforcement,"I genuinely do not like to complain about the homeless issue because I try to be understanding of disadvantaged people. That being said, the homeless population at this city park is becoming a major problem. This is the only dog park in the area for residents who may not have a vehicle to drive to other areas. The park often has an abundance of people without dogs hanging out within the fenced area during the day. When they leave, they leave the gates open - whether or not there is a dog present, which is extremely dangerous if someone should be there with a dog. It’s difficult to go to the park without being harassed for money or cat-called. I am always happy to offer spare change or food, but at this park I’ve had people insist that I give them $60 and offer to follow me to my bank for me to withdraw money when I tell them I do not carry money on myself. On a more troubling note, I’ve literally found a baggy of drugs on the ground within the fenced section of the park. It could easily be life threatening if a dog consumed a small baggy of drugs. I’ve found a used needle outside of the park and multiple other items utilized for drug use. I don’t want to force disadvantaged people away from a place where they are able to live freely, but there must be something that can be done to develop a balance between those who want to enjoy the park and those that live there.",2019-07-31T14:42:00.000,08/02/2019 09:09:00,An anonymous SeeClickFix user,404 S MAIN ST,29.6478935164935,-82.3253568230541,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.3253568230541, 29.6478935164935]}",1,2,15,1,1,1,772,1,08/02/2019 09:09:00,2547,1.76875,4,,,Lieutenant Joy Robinson,

So someone yellowed bagged it after 
Trash pick up 
The question is : 
Does it stay there until NEXT Wednesday ?
We posted this on Monday
Those yellow bags won’t stop the rain and animals ..
Also not open tore up garbage bag on the ground in the back ground 
And of course the big huge can back behind the fence that’s over flowing !! 
We assume it was moved back before the garbage truck got there ...??
Please advise 
We really should NOT have to look at that all week !!!

5459233,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,"Over the past several weeks, I've noticed a distinct increase in traffic congestion when traveling southbound on 43rd street between North West 51st Place and 39th Avenue in the mornings around 8:00 am. This is almost a 1-mile stretch that is bumper-to-bumper. I timed a green-light cycle at 39th for Southbound traffic that lasted 48 seconds. Meanwhile, the green light lasted about twice as long for those traveling E/W on 39th avenue.  Having never encountered such a congestion issue before on 43rd, I am concerned that the traffic light pattern has changed to prioritize E/W-bound traffic on 39th at the detriment of N/S-bound traffic on 43rd. Meanwhile, the traffic that gets stopped E/W on 39th is only a few cars deep, compared to nearly a mile stretch of congestion on 43rd. The same issue appears to be creating congestion heading North in the afternoons as well, with NB traffic backed up to Thornebrook Plaza on most days around 5:30 pm.

The raised berm in the Clear Lake area has all sorts of roots growing out of the top of the berm that need to be cut back. The dirt washes away from the top of the berm, exposing the roots.  Lots and lots of people walk on the berm every day.  You even have a real nice parking area for people to park at when they want to drive over to the berm and go for a walk on the top of the berm.  
The roots that are on the surface of the berm present a major trip and fall hazard to the people who walk on the berm. These roots used to be covered up with soil that has since washed away. You don’t need to put more dirt on the berm to cover up the roots. You just need to send someone out there to cut and remove the roots that have become exposed over time. They present a trip and fall hazard to the people who walk on the berm for exercise.

Please send someone out to cut the roots that are sticking out along the top of the berm.  I have tripped on them myself.
Please respond and let me know what you are going to do about this.
Thank you.

2670681,Archived,Street Sign,"To be clear, this sign is not obscured/overgrown, but there was not an option for unnecessary or dangerous, so I chose obscured/overgrown.

There is a four-way stop at this very low traffic intersection.  If you are heading south on NW 3rd street from NW 8th Ave, there is also a stop sign at NW 2nd Ave and the stop light at University Avenue.  Essentially, if you are going south, you will stop three time in two blocks.  Given the low traffic at this intersection, it seems unnecessary to have traffic in both directions come to a stop.  This may even be a good place for a roundabout, given the amount of traffic at the intersection.  At least, consideration should be given to only have traffic stop in one direction.

The decision to change the intersection at NW 3rd Street and NW 2nd Avenue from a four-way stop to only stopping in the south direction of NW 3rd Street seems crazy especially given the lack of visibility at this intersection and the designation of NW 2nd Ave as a ""bike corridor"".

3540678,Archived,Trash/Debris (Public Property),"I would like to bring to the attention of the Gainesville City Commissioners, the trash that often accumulates along the south side of State Road 24 between UF Health Shands and the Malcom Randall VA Hospital.

I gather that this area is sort of a “no-man’s” land with jurisdiction shared (or not shared) between the City, the University of Florida/Shands, and the VA.

I often walk from the parking garage near the corner of Gale Lemerand Dr and State Road 24 to my office in the Shands Facilities Administration Building. I am dismayed at the trash along the walking area—especially the medical related trash such as latex gloves and face masks and sadly copious cigarette butts.

Mostly recently it has been less littered, and I did make mention of the problem to someone at Shands—so perhaps some action was taken.

But what I would hope in the long term is that the entities involved would work together to provide regular clean up this area and a cooperative educational program for visitors, patients, and employees.

Because of the prominence of the UF Health Shands medical facility and the regional status of the VA, we have a lot of people from out of town visiting this area, and I would hope that the city, the hospitals, and the local community would take pride in showing visitors a well-kept public corridor.",2017-07-06T16:57:00.000,09/27/2018 13:23:00,City of Gainesville Neighbor,STATE RD 24,29.6519565,-82.3248251,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.3248251, 29.6519565]}",1,2,15,1,1,1,772,1,11/13/2017 16:06:00,,,4,,,Public Works Department (Primary),

7776216,Archived,Street Sign,"With lesser traffic on the roads, this might be the time to address this issue. For cars coming down the hill on 23rd St and approaching 8th Ave, at the junction, it is very difficult to see the vehicles coming down the hill (i.e. going east to west) due to lack of line of sight. This is particularly hazardous for those vehicles which intend to turn left. The drivers have to inch forward almost into inrushing traffic going west to east to make sure (a) there's no traffic on the left coming from the direction of 34th St and (b) after going quite a bit, then get the visibility of vehicles coming from the direction of 22nd St. The latter vehicles, coming down the hill, are often quite fast. So, the poor driver who's trying to turn left on 8th Ave suddenly finds herself trying to pull away from those cars coming down the hill, and the drivers on those cars then are trying to decelerate in the last second. This is all due to the fact that the cars that are on 23rd St cannot see the cars on 8th Ave (and vice versa) until they have forwarded well into 8th Ave. This is quite dangerous, and there needs to be some sort of a traffic signal at that intersection so that cars coming down the hill on 8th Ave know that they have to slow down in order to allow the cars on 23rd St turn safely right onto 8th Ave.",2020-05-07T18:46:00.000,11/19/2020 06:13:00,An anonymous SeeClickFix user,NW 23RD ST & NW 8TH AVE,29.6595309591424,-82.3565245125013,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.3565245125013, 29.6595309591424]}",3,,5,3,6,6,770,3,11/19/2020 06:13:00,281547,195.51875,1,05/11/2020 09:29:00,5203,Public Works Department (Primary),

I am writing about the intersection of SW 16th Avenue and SW 16th Street.  
 
The street light at this intersection was removed many months ago when new stoplights were installed.  The new traffic control lights are now fully operational, but the street light has not been replaced.  
 
This is a very busy intersection.  It is a block from both Shands and the VA hospitals, and gets a lot of pedestrian traffic before dawn.  
 
We have e-mailed several other city departments about this in the past month, but no action has been taken.  Let's not have a traffic accident or fatality that could have been prevented by a streetlight.
 
We trust that you can use your good offices to expedite the replacement of this streetlight.  Thank you very much.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Helen Warren,  as I send this, there is a crew from DOC cutting weeds out of the drainage ditches on SE 20 St.  This is the first time the weeds have been trimmed in over a year.

As I told you, the 10 houses on this street pay $1080.00 a year for stormwater  maintenance.  The ditches, now clear of weeds are still holding too much water.  I've been here 32 years, and the ditches used to work.  I want the ditches to drain.  They are not meant to be a half-mile retention pond breeding mosquitoes.

I want the culverts ""jetted"", the process using high pressure water to clear the dirt and debris from the culverts.

Subject: Noise Disturbance 

Hello,

There is a noise disturbance coming from 417 SW 40th terrace,Gainesville Fl 32607 in our neighborhood almost every night. This home has a dog that is left outside all night which barks and howls, disturbs peace and interrupts sleep. They leave their dog outside during very cold weather as well so it’s unclear whether the dog is so vocal due to neglect. Nonetheless it is a major disruption to nighttime sleeping hours and I’m requesting further assistance as it has affected any potential for restful sleep in our home. Several routine calls to nonemergency GPD over the years have not remedied the situation.

The Nuisance Alligator Hotline received a call from Thomas Hladish (512-971-9298) who was a Visitor to Sugarfoot Prairie Conservation Area (5480 Southwest 1 Avenue, Gainesville, Fl. 32607); Mr. Hladish expressed is concerns for the safety of people and pets who visit the park due to the presence of an approximate 8ft. alligator in the pond within the park. He stated that the alligator approached him. 

When a call is received via the Hotline from a visitor to a city, county or state park, we make every effort to let the managing authority of this area be aware of the complaint.  You may have staff that monitor these areas and are aware of the alligators that are residents there and are comfortable with their presence.
 
Additionally, we stand ready to assist with the dispatch of a nuisance alligator trapper should you decide that you have an alligator that you wish to have removed; however, that decision is entirely yours.

Be aware that if a permit is issued and a trapper dispatched, any alligator that is 4ft or larger is harvested, which means it is killed.
 
Please let us know if you have any questions.
You may contact SNAP via Email (SNAP@MyFWC.com) or by calling the SNAP Hotline directly, at the number listed below, where any operator will be happy to assist you.
 
The reference # associated with this complaint is 448578.

3078062,Archived,Tree/Limbs (Public Property),"My name is Susan Young and I have been a Gainesville resident for 24 years, and in my house at 911 N W 37th Terrace since 2004. I'll give you some history of my situation because I desperately need your help.
 
About six weeks ago, a tree located in the front yard of Alex and Jodi Farmer, my next door neighbors, was removed by the city of Gainesville.  Three weeks later, my neighbors across the street, Jack and Gretchen Grisby, had a tree removed in their front yard, also by the city of Gainesville and at no charge to them.  At some point during this time, my property was marked by GRU without my knowledge or consent.  Had my college-age child not been home, we would not have known how the stakes appeared in our yard.  On October 29, I was notified that I had a certified letter and waited over an hour to pick it up at the downtown Post Office. This letter was from E. Di Muccio and was a Notice of Violation regarding a dead tree in My yard and that, in order to clear the violation, I would have to have it taken down - at my own expense - by November 28. No tree was marked in my yard at the time, so I had to have the city arborist return to my property to mark the offending tree.  On further review, the tree seems to be located along the same public/ private line as my neighbor's tree. The tree that was recently removed at the city expense.
 
I am a divorced single mother, working for a non- profit company and I cannot afford to have this tree taken down, especially during the holiday season.  This situation has caused great hardship for me and for my family. I implore you to take another look at the property line and if there is any way to have the city help me, I would appreciate it.  I can be reached at my workplace at 548-1000 (from 8am - 4pm), or email: snyoung@oakhammock.org, or my cell phone: (352) 317-5319.  Thank you for your consideration on this matter.

The speeds at which these vehicles are traveling are not compatible with those on foot.

The Mayor and the Commissioners of Gainesville,

My neighborhood streets were recently repaired for pot holes and rough spots. The streets were solid, smooth and level. This turned out excellent. 

Then  you ruined the streets with slop put down by ASPHALT PAVING SYSTEMS. Now the streets are worse than they were. Some streets around here got real solid smooth asphalt. We got this.

The way it was done was terrible. A layer of gravel and tar was put down without warning and suddenly we couldn’t leave our house or return to them, and then we had to drive on it. A week later came the top coat. Same thing. I was ready to go to work and suddenly there’s wet tar in front of my house. I COULD NOT GO TO WORK. PEOPLE COULD NOT GO HOME. No warning. The crew said “Oh well.” This is inexcusable.  You should have warned people. Everyone I’ve talked to is livid.

Then there is the quality of the job. My street, 46th Place, is bad. 47th Avenue is even worse. But then they did pave it in the rain. Tar and water don’t mix.

It is rough, uneven, and peeling up. Weeds are growing through it already. It looks bad. Cars and trucks – especially the garbage trucks - tore it up. Cars that rode smooth now buzz with vibration. Everyone is commenting on how bad this is now, how bad it will be in a few months or a few years, what it will do to our property values. I can now see what  other streets were paved with this substance. It did not hold up – now they are ruts of gravel. This is my neighborhood’s future.

It is clear what this ASPHALT PAVING SYSTEMS is a bad product and they don’t care about the people who live here. It should not been used on a public street. This product should not be used again.

Has anyone from Public Works come to check the work? Have you asked the people who live on these streets about it?  Is there any quality control or follow up? I think the answers are “No.” 

If you think any of this is acceptable, think again. If you can’t afford to do it right, do not do it wrong. This was wrong.

3585601,Archived,Street Sign,"Commissioner Arreola received the following e-mail from Mr. Scott Oldham (352-316-5378 or soldham1@cox.net):

Dear Mr. Arreola,

I am writing you today to see if you can help with a problem in our sub-division.  Several months ago there was an auto accident at the entrance to Monterey at NW 34th Place and NW 43rd Street.  A vehicle went off the road and struck and damaged the sign for Monterey.  The driver of the car that damaged the sign was insured with Progressive Select Insurance Company.  One of our neighbors contacted Progressive and met with an adjuster to see about getting the sign repaired.  Progressive has denied the claim on the following basis.

Monterey sub-division does not have an active Home Owners Association that is responsible for the common areas of the development and therefore does not have an insurable interest in the sign.

It is true that we no longer have an HOA for this development.  Back shortly after the sub-division was built the original developer dissolved the HOA and deeded the common areas like the streets and entrance signs to the County.  When the city later annexed this area they became responsible for the common areas.  So at this point I understand the City of Gainesville is the owner of the entrance sign and would have an insurable interest in that property.

I am asking you for so assistance to see what can be done to repair the sign without any cost to the homeowners of Monterey or The City of Gainesville.  Maybe if the City Attorney were to talk to the adjuster from Progressive there could be a solution to this problem.

I know that the State of Florida requires all owners/operators of a motor vehicle to have Property Damage insurance of at least $10,000.  The State also requires the motor vehicle owner to pay for damage done to the property of others due to an automobile accident.  The problem here seems to revolve around just who owns the sign and has the insurable interest.

Please let me know if there is someway the City of Gainesville can help us get the sign repaired.  The homeowners have maintained the entrance planters and kept the sign painted for many years.  All we are asking is that the sign be repaired.  

Adjuster: Janae Liptlippap. Progressive Insurance Company Claim # 171523285 Adjusters Ph# 352-415-4289

Thanks for you time and understanding.

Sincerely

Scott Oldham

I daily take 7th Street to work and the intersection at NE 4th Avenue is incredibly dangerous. The issue appears to be that the median creating the roundabout is not large enough you people on NE 4th Avenue are not required to slow down and typically go through the intersection between 20 and 30mph. This has almost led to countless accidents which I have witnessed and per a friend who lives at the intersection has led to multiple cars crashing into her fence. Please improve this intersection by turning it into a 4 way stop or increasing the median size to force the vehicles on NE 4th Avenue to slow down.

Thank you.",2021-04-06T20:25:00.000,06/16/2021 07:08:00,Daimian Holiday Scott,309 SE 7TH ST,29.6485921441903,-82.3178125731647,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.3178125731647, 29.6485921441903]}",1,2,17,1,1,1,772,1,,,,4,04/06/2021 20:25:00,0,Public Works Department (Primary),

there is a police report showing she lied about me trespassing... anyway, i don't want to worry about this... her set up SHOULD BE DISMANTLED, and if u want to go for two on the same street i believe its the house for sale, same set up:

2152170,Archived,Traffic/Pedestrian Signal,"There are multiple issues with the intersection. The vehicle trigger on the left hand turn lane onto northbound 98th St. will trigger when no car is there. This causes a turn arrow to appear even though no car is there. I haven't seen this issue in a few days so it may be resolved already.

Second issue is the light will change to green for east/west bound traffic when there is no vehicle there to trigger it. This stops north/south bound traffic, and due to the previously mentioned trigger of a turn signal for no vehicles turning, adds even more time of waiting on nothing.

Third issue is the timing in general for the east/west bound green light is way too long. It will turn green for a few cars in the east/south bound lanes and stay green for a VERY long time even though it isn't needed at all. It should turn green, allow the few cars there to go, then change back to red shortly after since north/south traffic is heavy on that road.

Last, but certainly not least - the left turn lane onto east 23rd Ave doesn't stay green long enough. The green arrow is long enough for 3 cars, if lucky, to get through. This isn't long enough to empty the turn lane itself during busier hours, and causes many drivers to just run the light. Due to all the issues further up, it can be VERY frustrating to be someone in the left hand turn lane, and since north/south bound traffic is so heavy on this road, drivers often get a chance to turn only when given the green arrow.",2016-01-12T15:58:00.000,09/26/2018 07:33:00,IamMeeks,NW 23RD AVE AND NW 98TH ST INTERSECTION,29.6743975168746,-82.4465592897978,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-82.4465592897978, 29.6743975168746]}",,,,,10,10,769,,01/12/2016 16:05:00,6,0.004166666666666666666666666667,,,,Public Works Department (Primary),
